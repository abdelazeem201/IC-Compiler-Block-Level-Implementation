#                                                                                        	   #
# 0.2           12/Dec/2011     (Second draft)  	Changed  M1 from minSpacing = 0.05  to     #  
#                                              		minSpacing = 0.056.                        #
#												   #
# 0.3		14/Dec/2011	(Third draft)   	Corrected "fattbldimension" attribute for  #
#					       		M9 layer. (This error was the reason of    #
#					       		fatal error in ICC) .       		   # 
#												   #
# 0.4           16/Dec/2011     (Forth draft) 	 	Corrected Pitchs Of M* metal  layers.      #
#												   #
# 0.5		18/Dec/2011	(Fifth draft) 	 	Corrected measurement units, correspon-    #
#					      		ding to technology libraries units.	   #
#					      	 	Added cut*-tables and DesignRules for them #
#					      		for Zroute algorithm in ICC.		   #
#												   #
# 0.6		12/Jul/2012	(Six draft)   		Corrected Stackable option to different    #
#							vias	 				   #
# 0.7		17/Jul/2012	(Seventh draft)		Add Metal Span Spacing Rule		   #
#												   #
# 0.8		unknown		(Eight draft)		- removed metal span spacing rules         #
#							- removed concaveMetalToCutMinDist         #
#							- changed cutTblSize to 8 when 8 entries   #
#							  present in the CutTbl                    #
#                                                                                                  #
# 0.9		15/12/2012	(Cut table issues)	- Changed cutTblSize to 4 as there are     # 
#							  only 4 cut combinations according to DRM #
#                                                       - Removed extra cut names                  #
#							- Changed cut names to differ from         #
#							  ContactCode names                        #
#                                                       - Removed sameNetMinSpacing from M1        #
#                                                       - Fixed rounded fat table thresholds       #
