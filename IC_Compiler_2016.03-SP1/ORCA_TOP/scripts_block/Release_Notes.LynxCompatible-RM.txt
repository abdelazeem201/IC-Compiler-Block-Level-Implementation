*  General metric enhancements - The procedures that extract metric
   information from reports have been updated to reflect the latest 
   techniques consistent with the Lynx production flows.
   
   This update includes improved support for power and automatic test pattern 
   generation (ATPG) metrics.

*  An additional file is now placed in the rpts directory.
   
   The name of the file ends with *flow_summary.qor. This file will become
   useful in future Runtime Manager (RTM) flow reporting capabilities.

*  The metric tag SVAR(tag10) is no longer available for general use.

   You can use metric tags SVAR(tag01) through SVAR(tag09), which are
   available in the Lynx Block Variable Editor, if you want to enhance the 
   grouping of metrics for project reporting.


Support File Updates for the Lynx Compatible Reference Methodology Flows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mvrc tasks that Lynx uses in multi_product_sample_upf_flow.xml have 
been updated to improve naming conventions, and the mvrc_icc task has 
been corrected to use the rm_icc_scripts/mvrc.tcl script rather than the
rm_dc_scripts/mvrc.tcl script used by the mvrc_dc task.


G-2012.06-SP4
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the 
Lynx-Compatible reference methodology scripts for version G-2012.06-SP4.

Support File Updates for lcrm_setup.tcl
---------------------------------------

*  General metric enhancements -- the procedures that extract metric information 
   from reports have been updated to reflect the latest techniques consistent with 
   the Lynx production flows.

*  Support has been added to detect multicorner and multimode use in Design Compiler 
   and adjust the reports and metrics to be scenario based.

*  Metrics for PrimeTime are now based on report_qor rather than report_constraints.

*  Default settings have been added for several variables associated with the newer 
   Lynx Runtime Manager (RTM).


Support File Updates for the Lynx Compatible Reference Methodology Flows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No changes have been made for this release.


G-2012.06 
=========

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the 
Lynx-Compatible reference methodology scripts for version G-2012.06.

Lynx Support File Updates for lcrm_setup.tcl
--------------------------------------------

*  The lcrm_setup.tcl script has been changed to regenerate the SYS.BLOCK metric 
   at the end of every Lynx-compatible reference methodology (LCRM) task, based on 
   the DESIGN_NAME variable from common_setup.tcl.
   
   This change provides the correct metric record from the Lynx-compatible reference
   methodology scripts when you run the scripts by using the Lynx Design System 
   Runtime Manager. Previously, lcrm_setup.tcl generated SYS.BLOCK only at the 
   beginning of each task, before DESIGN_NAME was defined in the script.

*  Support has been added for the Lynx "early completion" feature.

   Although this feature is not used by the default Lynx-compatible reference 
   methodology scripts, it is now available if you want to use it in custom flows.

*  The procedures used to parse metrics from reports have been updated for 
   consistency with the latest versions of the Lynx production scripts.


Lynx Support File Updates for the Lynx-Compatible Reference Methodology Flows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  The content of the template flows has been updated to remove Load_DC_database 
   and Load_ICC_database because they are no longer required. 
   
   The new version of the Lynx Runtime Manager can use the Run View feature 
   to load the databases for Lynx-compatible reference methodology tasks.

*  Notes have been added to some of the XML flows to provide guidance for:

   o  Downloading all the required reference methodology scripts that are referenced 
      in the flow
   
   o  Removing optional tasks that the Lynx flow checks might flag as pointing to 
      missing script files

*  The rm_dc_upf.xml flow template has been added to support the execution of 
   Design Compiler IEEE 1801 flows.
   
   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).

*  The signoff_opt command has been removed from all IC Compiler design flows and 
   from sample design flows involving IC Compiler because of changes in the 
   IC Compiler Reference Methodology.
   
   The signoff_opt_icc task has been removed from the IC Compiler Reference 
   Methodology scripts because the signoff_opt command has been de-emphasi8zed 
   in IC Compiler version G-2012.06. For more details, see the IC Compiler 
   Reference methodology Release Notes. 

*  A NOTE object has been added to each sample flow, with simple instructions for 
   changing the top flow of a block by using the Block Flow Manager.


F-2011.09-SP2/F-2011.12
=======================

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the 
Lynx-Compatible reference methodology scripts for version F-2011.09-SP2.

Lynx Support File Updates for lcrm_setup.tcl
--------------------------------------------

*  The Tcl variable sh_continue_on_error is now set true in the lcrm_setup.tcl 
   script to enforce a consistent behavior across all tcl shell tools when an error 
   is encountered. This overcomes a hang condition seen when running MVTOOLs in the 
   Lynx environment.

*  General metric enhancements - Updated the procedures which extract metric 
   information from reports to reflect the latest techniques

Lynx Support File Updates for the Lynx-Compatible  Reference Methodology Flows
-----------------------------------------------============-------------------

*  Added rm_dc_upf.xml and multiproduct_sample_upf_flow.xml flow files as templates 
   for working with UPF flows. They add MVRC tasks to the base flows.


F-2011.09/F-2011.06-SP2
=======================

In this release of the Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts, the procedures 
in lcrm_setup.tcl that extract metric information from reports have been updated to 
reflect the latest techniques for extracting this information.


E-2010.12-SP4/F-2011.06
=======================

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the 
Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts for version E-2010.12-SP4.

Lynx Support File Updates for lcrm_setup.tcl
--------------------------------------------

*  The lcrm_setup.tcl file now sources system.tcl from the Lynx workspace area when 
   running in the Lynx Runtime Manager (RTM).
   
   This change provides support for setting Lynx System Environment Variables, 
   such as SEV(project_name) for managing metrics.
   
   Note:
      The default project name setting for the Lynx-compatible reference 
      methodology scripts is project_name=lcrm.

*  Metric TAG support has been added. 

   TAGs provide an option for managing metrics from different runs, experiments, 
   teams, and so forth for easy filtering in the Lynx Management Cockpit. When 
   running in the RTM, you have the option to set SVAR(TAG) in the Block Variable 
   Editor graphical user interface (GUI). This results in TAG string settings that 
   become part of a SYS.TAG.XX metric in every task. The values set in the GUI are 
   stored in conf/block.tcl.

*  Support has been added for handling tool command language (Tcl) tasks that do 
   not support the source options -e and -v. 

   This capability is used in the StarRC Reference Methodology.

*  New metrics have been added for CELL_AREA, clock skew, and the 
   multicorner-multimode summary.
   
   User strings like path_group names and scenario names that become metrics now 
   handle special characters (/-()[]%&@!~) by replacing them with an underscore (_)
   only for the string that appears as the metric. 


Lynx Support File Updates for the Lynx-Compatible Reference Methodology Flows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  The focal_opt_icc task has been added to the rm_icc.xml and 
   multi_product_sample_flow.xml files.
   
   This task is not tied into the flow, but you can run it by explicitly executing 
   the task in the Lynx Execution Monitor or by customizing the flow to tie the 
   task into the flow goal with an edge.

*  The rm_icc_hier_odl.xml flow has been updated to reflect the latest IC Compiler
   on-demand loading task and script names.

*  The new signoff_drc_icc task for the IC Compiler Reference Methodology has been 
   added to the rm_icc.xml flow and in multi_product_sample_flow.xml.

*  The Load_DC_database and Load_ICC_database tasks have been added to rm_dc.xml 
   and rm_icc.xml. 

   These tasks are optional utilities for loading the tool and setup file so that 
   you can load a results database interactively.

*  Changes have been made to correct the StarRC, TetraMAX, and PrimeTime tasks in 
   multi_product_sample_flow.xml.
   
   For one of these changes, the target "all" has been added at the end of each 
   flow for consistency across all the product reference methodology flows.
