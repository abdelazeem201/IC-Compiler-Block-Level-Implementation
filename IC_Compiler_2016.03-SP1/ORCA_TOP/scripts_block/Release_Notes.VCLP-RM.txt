J-2014.09-SP2

Reference Methodology does not include any product-specific changes. However,

methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the file named

J-2014.09
=========

The Synopsys Verification Compiler Low Power Static Signoff Reference Methodology, 
formerly the Synopsys Verdi(R) Signoff-LP Low Power Static Signoff Reference 
Methodology, has been renamed to be consistent with the new tool name. The 
functionality of the scripts is the same, but names and variables have been updated 
to match the new product name.

*  The vsi.tcl script in rm_dc_scripts has been renamed to vc_lp.tcl.
*  The vsi_top.tcl script in rm_dc_scripts has been renamed to vc_lp_top.tcl.
*  The vsi.tcl script in rm_icc_scripts has been renamed to vc_lp.tcl.

The scripts now use the Verification Compiler Low Power Static Signoff tool 
shell, vc_static_shell, instead of the Verdi Signoff-LP Low Power Static Signoff 
tool shell, vsi_shell.

This release also provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology 
flow. For information about these enhancements, see the file named 
Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.
