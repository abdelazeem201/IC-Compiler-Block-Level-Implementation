I-2013.12-SP2, I-2013.12-SP4, J-2014.09, and J-2014.09-SP2
==========================================================

These releases of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology do not include
any product-specific changes. However, they do provide support for the enhancements
in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow. For information about these
enhancements, see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


I-2013.12
=========

General Updates
---------------

*  The definition of the MVRC_RUN variable has been moved to the dc_setup.tcl file.

*  The name of the RTL read script variable has been updated to
   MVRCRM_RTL_READ_SCRIPT and defined in the dc_setup_filename.tcl file.

*  The MVRCRM_RTL_READ_SCRIPT script is now a Tool Command Language (Tcl) script, 
   which allows the script log execution to be printed on screen.

   MVRCRM_RTL_READ_SCRIPT should include an exec call before each mvcmp command.
   For example,

   o  In a script for Verilog or SystemVerilog: 
   
      exec mvcmp -vlogan <vlogan command line>

   o  In a script for VHDL: 
   
      exec mvcmp -vhdlan <vhdlan command line>


Common Changes in mvrc(_top).tcl
--------------------------------

Extra comments have been added to the scripts, clarifying the steps performed 
in the verification process.


Changes in mvrc_top.tcl
-----------------------

For the NETLIST verification, the reading order of the hierarchical and top 
design mapped netlist has been changed to ensure the correct implementation 
of the complete design.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

The setting of the MVRC_RUN variable, which controls the stage that runs MVRC, 
is now located in the Setup Variable section in dc_setup.tcl.


Changes in dc_setup_filenames.tcl
---------------------------------

The MVRCRM_RTL_READ_SCRIPT variable, which points to the read RTL script, is now
located in the dc_setup_filename.tcl file.


Lynx Compatibility
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


G-2012.06, G-2012.06-SP4, H-2013.03 and  H-2013.03-SP2
======================================================

These releases of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology do not include 
any product-specific changes. However, they do provide support for the enhancements 
in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow. For information about these 
enhancements, see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09-SP2 and F-2011.09-SP4
===============================

These releases of the MVRC Static Verification Reference Methodology do not include 
any product-specific changes. However, they do provide support for the enhancements 
in the Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow. 

For the Design Compiler Reference Methodology, which did not participate in the 
F-2011.09-SP2 reference methodology release, the Lynx-compatible reference 
methodology enhancements take affect in the F-2011.09-SP4 release.

For information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology enhancements, 
see the file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.


F-2011.09
=========

General Updates
---------------

The sh_continue_on_error variable is now set to true to match the behavior 
of other Synopsys tools.


Changes in mvrc(_top).tcl for the Design Compiler Reference Methodology
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*  The MVRC_RTL_READ_SCRIPT variable is now defined in both the standard and 
   Lynx-compatible reference methodology flows to resolve a problem in previous 
   releases.

*  The script has been updated to use MVRC_RTL_READ_SCRIPT when you select the 
   AUTOREAD setting for the RTL Source Format option in RMgen. 
   
   This variable is necessary because Design Compiler does not write an RTL read 
   script for MVRC. Previous releases used the MVRC_RTL_AUTOREAD_SCRIPT variable 
   when you selected the AUTOREAD setting. 


Lynx Compatibility 
-------------------

This release provides enhancements in the Lynx-compatible reference 
methodology flow. For information about these enhancements, see the 
file named Release_Notes.LynxCompatible-RM.txt.
