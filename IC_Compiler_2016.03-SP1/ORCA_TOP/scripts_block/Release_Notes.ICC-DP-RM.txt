I-2013.12
=========

IC Compiler Design Planning Reference Methodology version I-2013.12 provides 
the following new features, enhancements, and changes.

*  The set_dont_touch_placement and remove_dont_touch_placement commands have 
   been replaced with instances of the set_attribute command for the is_fixed
   cell attribute.
   
   o  Setting is_fixed to true is equivalent to using the set_dont_touch_placement 
      command.

      set_attribute $cells is_fixed true
   
   o  Setting is_fixed to false is equivalent to using the 
      remove_dont_touch_placment command.

   These changes have been applied in multiple script files. For further
